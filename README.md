## 📊 How to Use

1. **Input Transaction Details**:
   Fill out the required fields for transaction data. This includes the amount, transaction type, and other necessary details.

2. **Submit Your Data**:
   Click the “Submit” button to send your data for analysis.

3. **Review Results**:
   The application will analyze the data and provide feedback on whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

## 🎓 Understanding the Model

The Credit Card Fraud Detection application uses advanced machine learning techniques to analyze transaction data. Here are a few concepts explained:

- **Random Forest**: A type of model that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.
- **XGBoost**: Another model known for its speed and efficiency in prediction tasks.
- **SMOTE**: A technique to balance the dataset by creating synthetic examples of the minority class (fraudulent transactions).

These techniques work together to improve the detection of fraud while minimizing incorrect flags on valid transactions.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you experience issues, consider the following common troubleshooting tips:

- **Python Not Recognized**: Ensure Python is added to your system’s PATH during installation.
- **Missing Packages**: If you see errors stating that a package is missing, you can install required packages by running:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Slow Performance**: Check your system’s RAM and free disk space. Ensure no other heavy applications are running.
