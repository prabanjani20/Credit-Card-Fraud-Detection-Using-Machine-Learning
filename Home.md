## Overview

This project is a web-based, machine learning-powered system for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.  
It supports eight ML models, Hybrid Model ensemble methods, interactive visualizations, and a mobile-friendly Progressive Web App (PWA) interface.

---

## Features

- Real-time fraud prediction (sub-500ms)
- 3 ML algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, Hybrid (RF + XGB)
- Ensemble, weighted, and sequential prediction methods
- Responsive dashboard and mobile PWA
- CSV upload and batch analysis
- Interactive charts (Plotly.js)
- Offline support and installable app

---

## System Architecture

- **Backend:** Python Flask
- **ML:** scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Plotly.js
- **PWA:** Service Worker, Manifest
- **Model Storage:** Pickle (PKL), JSON (XGBoost)

## Machine Learning Models

| Short Name     | Model Name     | Description                                                                   |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| rf        | Random Forest        | Ensemble of multiple decision trees that improves accuracy and reduces |overfitting.|
| xgb       | XGBoost              | Optimized and scalable gradient boosting algorithm for high-performance |prediction. |
| hybrid    | Hybrid Model (RF + XGBoost)| Combines Random Forest and XGBoost using weighted probabilities for robust fraud detection. |

## Prediction Methods

- **Single Model:** Use one ML model for prediction.
- **Ensemble:** Majority voting between two models.
- **Weighted:** Weighted average based on model accuracy.
- **Sequential:** Second model used if first model’s confidence is low.

## Web Interface & PWA

- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Sidebar navigation for all pages
- PWA features: offline mode, install prompt, background sync
- Pages: Dashboard, Model, Visualizations, Analysis, Theory, Features, Amount Trends, Offline
